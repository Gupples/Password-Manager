# Overview

In order to grow as a programmer and diversify my portfolio, I decided to learn how to program in Rust.

This program is a simple password manager written in Rust. I have used object-oriented programming to encapsulate the password manager as a single struct to allow easy modification of the database of url's, usernames, and passwords.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
This program is meant to be a demonstration of what I have learned about programming in Rust and different strategies after not knowing anything about the language beforehand.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
For this project, I used Visual Studios Code as the text editor.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I created this program using the Rust language, and I imported the input/output crate of the standard library (std::io).

# Future Work

- Deleting an entry doesn't delete the password. I would like to fix this.
- Add more error handling/user entry safety measures. 
- Enable lasting functionality by incorporating reading from/writing to a CSV.
